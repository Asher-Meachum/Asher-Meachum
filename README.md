## Hail, and well met...
I am Asher Bernstein-Meachum, a (Micro)Python developer (for now). I like many things, including, but not limited to: cybersecurity, Rust, system development (esp. OS development), and Python, of course (and parentheses, evidently).

## Projects
### Current
- [ULN2003](https://github.com/Asher-Meachum/ULN2003_DRIVER) - A simple (for now) Micropython driver for the ULN2003 driver.
### Finished
- [Project Robot](https://github.com/Asher-Meachum/Project-Robot) - Science Olympiad/Fair code. It isn't pretty.
